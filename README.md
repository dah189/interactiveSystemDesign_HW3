## interactiveSystemDesign_HW3
#### This is my Assignment 3 for the course - Interactive System Design.
##### I use the java swing to build a simple GUI which can design a personal badge. In this project, you can change any features and get the feedback in real time. And also you will get an error message if the operation is wrong.

##### I bulid this Gui in five classes. The main one is GuiBadge. In this class, you can find the frame of total Gui, some Listener and their methods. In Badge2 class, it contains the method of drawing the badge. In errorPanel class, it contains the method of drawing the error panel. In MyButton class, it contains the method of drawing the button which could has different shape on it. In JTextFieldHintListener class, it contains the method of showing the tips in JTextField.

#### How to use this file:
##### If you only want to see the application, download the .jar file and import in your IDE.
##### If you want to see the code, download the all java files in src. And execute the GuiBadge.java.

> I feel so happy that I can write this code in my second semster to learn the programming. I love to learn something new and make it conme true.
